## The schematic diagram of the robot leg
The base plate is connected to end-effector plate by three RRS-chains. Each chain consists of two links, former two joints being revolute joint and the last joint being spherical joint. Two of revolute joints on the base plate are parallel to each other as shown follows:

## Robot Leg Rotation Simulation
In order to get the joint angles curve of the robot during the climbing process, we established a simulation model in MATLAB, the result is shown in Fig. 6. In this figure, the black and the orange triangle refer to the end-effector and the base respectively. The red link and the green link represent the upper arm and the lower arm respectively. Lastly, the blue line means the curve pipe.
